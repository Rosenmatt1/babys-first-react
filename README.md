# Baby's First React App
### A Todo List for forgetful people.

### Specs
- Use the corresponding Todos API 
  - You can use the deployed version [here.](https://galvanize-todos-api.herokuapp.com/) Keep in mind, todos you add and delete will be visible to everyone using this API. 
  - Or you can fork and clone and run the API [locally.](https://github.com/aimeeroxanne/project_todosAPI)

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add tasks to a list so I can keep track of what needs to get done 
- As a user, I want to mark tasks 'completed' so I know what's done
- As a user, I want to prioritize tasks so I know what tasks are urgent or important
- As a user, I want remove tasks that are no longer relevant so they aren't a part of my history
