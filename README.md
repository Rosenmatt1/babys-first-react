# Baby's First React App
### A Todo List for forgetful people.

Your goal is to create a simple Todo List App that fulfills the user stories below. This project is meant to be open ended, so feel free to make it your own. Consider style, user experience, and feature branch workflow. 

### Specs
- Use the corresponding Todos API 
  - You can use the deployed version [here.](https://galvanize-todos-api.herokuapp.com/) Keep in mind, todos you add and delete will be visible to everyone using this API. 
  - Or you can fork and clone and run the API [locally.](https://github.com/aimeeroxanne/project_todosAPI)

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add tasks to a list so I can keep track of what needs to get done 
- As a user, I want to mark tasks 'completed' so I know what's done
- As a user, I want to prioritize tasks so I know what tasks are urgent or important
- As a user, I want remove tasks that are no longer relevant so they aren't a part of my history
